Story 4:
	As a robot I want to move forward for 1 seconds, pause for 1 second and reverse for 1 seconds so that I can display basic motor control
Story 4 Acceptance Criteria:
	Given the code is deployed when the reset button is pressed the robot moves forwards for 1 seconds, stops for 1 second and reverses for 1 seconds repeatedly.


Story 5:
	As a robot I want to drive forward for 10 seconds in a straight line so that I can display accurate motor control
Story 5 Acceptance Criteria:
	Given the code is deployed when the reset button is pressed the robot moves forwards for 10 seconds and stops and the robot has not veered more that 2cm from a straight line and the robot remains stopped


Story 6:
	As a robot I want to drive forward 2 meters and stop so that I can display accurate distance measurement
Story 6 Acceptance Criteria:
	Given the code is deployed when the reset button is pressed the robot moves forwards 2 meters and stops and remains stopped.


Story 7:
	As a robot I want to be able to move forward creating a square shape so that I can display accurate turning features
Story 7 Acceptance Criteria:
	Given the code is deployed when the reset button is pressed the robot moves forwards x and turns 90 degrees, repeating until a square is drawn. On completion of the robot stops and remains stopped.


Story 10:
	As a robot I want to stop before I hit an obstable so that I do not get damaged
Story 10 Acceptance Criteria:
	Given the robot is moving forwards when it encounters an obstacle then it must stop, pause and turn 90 degrees left without hitting the obstabcle


Story 11:
	As a robot I want to stop if there is no ground within 5cm of the front of the robot
Story 11 Acceptance Criteria:
	Given the robot is moving forwards when it encounters a drop in terrain of 5cms it is to continue, when it encounters a drop in terrain of 6 cms it is to stop and reverse 10cm, stop and remain stopped.


Story 12:
	As a robot I want to follow a homing beacon so that I can find my way to safety at the end of a mission
Story 12 Acceptance Criteria:
	Given the front of is a 145 degrees to a light source when the reset button is pressed then robot must find a light and drive towards it.


Story 13:
	As a robot I want to follow a homing beacon across hostile terrain, safely avoiding obstacles and steep drops whilst continuing to follow the beacon so that I can find my way safely back at the end of a mission
Story 13 Acceptance Criteria:
	Given the robot has found and is following a light as in S12, it must stop at obstacles and find a way around until it arrives at the light source.
